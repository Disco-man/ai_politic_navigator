The outcome will shape U.S. policy on climate change, healthcare, immigration, and foreign affairs for the next four years.",
          "background": "The 2024 election takes place against a backdrop of deep political division in the United States. Issues such as economic inequality, healthcare reform, immigration policy, and the role of the federal government have created stark divides between political parties and among the American electorate.",
          "full_history": "The 60th United States presidential election, held on November 5, 2024, was a fiercely contested battle between the Republican nominee, President Donald Trump, and the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris. The election cycle was historically unprecedented and highly volatile, marked by the dramatic late-stage withdrawal of incumbent President Joe Biden from the Democratic ticket in July 2024, two assassination attempts on Trump, and deep partisan polarization.\n\nThe Republican Party (GOP), led by Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance, successfully capitalized on widespread voter dissatisfaction regarding cumulative inflation, the cost of living, and border security. The Trump campaign's \"America First\" platform promised sweeping deregulation, universal tariffs, and aggressive immigration enforcement. This messaging resonated strongly across rural areas, the working class, and key swing states, ultimately securing Trump both the Electoral College and the popular vote, alongside a Republican takeover of the Senate.\n\nConversely, the Democratic Party, helmed by Kamala Harris and Tim Walz after Biden's exit, focused heavily on defending democratic institutions, protecting reproductive rights (following the overturn of Roe v. Wade), and expanding middle-class economic programs. Despite mobilizing significant urban and suburban coalitions, the Democratic ticket struggled to overcome the electorate's overarching economic anxieties and the historical burden of the Biden-Harris administration's incumbency.\n\nGeopolitically, Trump's definitive victory signaled an immediate and massive shift in U.S. foreign policy. The incoming Republican administration promised a sharp departure from the Biden-era emphasis on traditional multilateralism. Foreign capitals and global markets were forced to rapidly adjust to the return of transactional diplomacy, heightened skepticism toward NATO funding, and intense trade protectionism, particularly aimed at aggressive economic decoupling from China.",
